# odin-recipes

This is a simple recipe web site that I created as an assignment for the Odin Project.

Creating the site I have learned to create HTML pages with boilerplate, headings, paragraphs, images, links, ordered and unordered lists.

I have also learned to create a timeline of my progress of coding the site, by commiting the code in several commits using git.
