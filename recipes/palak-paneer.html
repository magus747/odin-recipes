    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dish is a recurring weekday favorite at our house. 
        It is easy to prepare, high in protein, and, most importantly, very tasty! 
        The spice amounts are approximate. I usually add them to taste. 
        For example, if you don't want a very strong stew, you can be careful 
        with the chili or, if you love heat, just go ahead and add a lot! 
        Experiment and find a mix that suits you.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 packages paneer cheese (about 450 g)</li>
        <li>200 g fresh spinach</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 piece of ginger (about 2-3 cm)</li>
        <li>1 tsp coriander</li>
        <li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp chili powder</li>
        <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>2 tbsp flour</li>
        <li>5 dl water</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch black pepper</li>
        <li>Lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by boiling the water and chopping the onion, garlic, and ginger.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, sauté the spices in butter for a few minutes (don't skimp on the butter!).</li>
        <li>Add the onion and garlic and sauté for an additional 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the flour, and then gradually pour in the hot water while whisking to thicken the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the spinach and let the dish simmer for a few minutes until the spinach wilts and the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Use a hand blender to quickly blend the sauce (if you prefer whole spinach leaves, you can skip this step).</li>
        <li>Cut the paneer cheese into small cubes (about 1x2 cm) and fry in a frying pan until lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Add the paneer to the sauce and season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Serve with freshly cooked rice.</li>
    </ol>
